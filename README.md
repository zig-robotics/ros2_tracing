# Zig package for ros2 tracing

**This repo is deprecated, please see the [zigros mono repo](https://github.com/zig-robotics/zigros) for updates.**
Maintaining individual repos paired with the zig package manager is too error prone.

This provides a zig package for the ros2 tracing project.
This currently targets zig 0.13 and ROS Jazzy.

So far this package is built just to meet include requirements of other ROS packages. It disables
all features, and enabling functionality has not been tested.
